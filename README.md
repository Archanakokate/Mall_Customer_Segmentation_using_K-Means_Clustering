Grouping Customers of a Retail store based on their purchase history using  K-means clustering algorithm

This project involves using a dataset for customer segmentation in a supermarket mall, focusing on market basket analysis. The dataset contains information such as Customer ID, age, gender, annual income, and a spending score assigned to customers based on their behavior and purchasing data. The goal is to use unsupervised machine learning (specifically, KMeans Clustering) to:

Achieve customer segmentation in the simplest way using Python.
Identify target customers who are more likely to respond to marketing strategies.
Gain insights into how marketing strategies can be applied effectively in the real world based on customer segmentation.
The project aims to help the mall owner understand their customer base, identify potential target customers, and develop marketing strategies accordingly.
